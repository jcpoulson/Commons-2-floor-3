                <h3>About Josh Rozelle</h3>
                <p>My Name is Josh and this is my third year at Liberty. I am double majoring in project management and automotive dealership management. I love doing anything outdoors, especially hiking, shooting, and sports. I could talk about cars all day and love anything to do with them. I have played drums for over 10 years and it is one of my favorite hobbies. Drums have given me many great opportunities for traveling and ministry and I plan to continue that for as long as I can. I want this hall to be a tight nit group with no outsiders. I understand that everyone is going to have their “people”, but no one should ever feel like they do not belong. If we can do this, we are going to have an amazing year.</p>

                <h3>Josh's testimony</h3>
                <p>I have grown up in church, my family was always involved and always serving. That doesn’t mean I didn’t have problems though, far from it actually. I have felt the overwhelming grace of God in my life and have lots of stories I can tell about how he has been faithful to me. My walk with God is what has made me who I am, without putting my trust in him and letting him guide my life I would not be here on this campus with you all right now. I could go on and on about how he has showed up in my life, but come ask me and find out for yourself!</p>
