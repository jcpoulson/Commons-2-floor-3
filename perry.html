                <h3>About Perry Burress</h3>
                <p>Hey everyone, my name is Perry Burress. I am from a small town called Wytheville, Virginia. This will be my second year at Liberty studying Accounting. I lived in commons last year and am looking forward to living in commons again. Somethings I enjoy are hiking, camping, the outdoors in general, football, basketball, soccer, and music, both listening and playing. I have played the violin for 14 years and I can make my way around the mandolin and guitar. I look forward to getting to know everyone this fall!</p>

                <h3>Perry's testimony</h3>
                <p>I have grown up in church and a family full of believers and always been active in our church. It has been a blessing because I have had several people to guide me on my walk. In middle school, I made the decision to follow Christ and accepted him into my heart. I would like to say that since that day my life has been a breeze, but it's quite the opposite. I have learned to lean on and trust the Lord because he ultimately knows the best for me and my life. Since my time at Liberty, my faith has grew around a community of fellow believers who challenge me to grow deeper and sharpen my faith. </p>
