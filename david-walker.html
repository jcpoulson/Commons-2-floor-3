                <h3>David's testimony</h3>
                <p>-I had grown up going to church and in a Christian home but all that meant for me was that I had a lot head knowledge about God but not really any heart change in me. 

                    I could explain all the verses about Gods love but I didn‚Äôt know what it meant our felt like.
                    
                    The majority of my childhood 
                    
                    growing up was filled with sports and school, and my relationship with God came second,
                    
                    -I came to faith during the summer of my sophomore year of high school at a church camp after hearing a sermon preached and 
                    
                    it blew my mind when I started  to understand that the God of the universe wants to have a relationship with me but my sin is in the way.
                    
                    I accepted Christ right there and then my priorities changed as I started to live for him.
                    
                    -It wasn‚Äôt until my senior year when
                    
                    I had the opportunity to play football in college 
                    
                    that God got a hold of my life and I instead finally surrendered to him to follow the call of vocational ministry!
                    
                    Then from a crazy turn of events, I took a leap of faith and applied to Liberty and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I made because this is such a special place with phenomenal people!
                    
                    
                    I‚Äôve been an RA for the past 3 years and I‚Äôd have to say that the craziest thing that I‚Äôve seen happened in my first year..ask me sometime and I‚Äôd be glad to share!</p>
