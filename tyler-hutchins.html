                <h3>About Tyler Hutchins</h3>
                <p>Hi guys! My name is Tyler Hutchins. I am a junior and a pastoral leadership major. I’m from Asheville, North Carolina and have lived in commons my whole time at LU!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="testimony">

                <h3>Tyler's testimony</h3>
                <p>I grew up in a Christian household and got baptized at age 8, however, I was not serious about my faith until much later. I have always been a little bit of an introvert but in middle and high school, worldly living put me into a cycle of bad mental health and worldly habits. I knew the way I was living was wrong, but I had no real desire to change. I knew just enough salvation doctrine to be dangerous. I knew doctrinally speaking, I didn’t believe a person could lose their salvation. So, I thought it was alright to continue living the way I was. (Boy was I wrong. Hopefully, I don’t need to point out the fallacy in my thinking!)

                    There were days in school that I would not speak to anyone: eat, sleep, and school was all I did. This continued for many years. Freshman year of college was a wakeup call for me, being away from home brought my sin habits and mental health to a breaking point. Combine that with a major I was not enjoying, and you get a recipe for disaster. This is when I did something that was probably rash and not well thought out, I enlisted in the US Army (Va National Guard to be specific). looking back, that was definitely where God wanted me to be though.
                    
                    So, I put my life on pause for six months and went to Initial Entry Training at Fort Jackson SC, and JEB Little Creek. I disenrolled from LU for a year and shipped out on June 25, 2018. Basic training was rough, but it was exactly what I needed. Six months of separation from the world forced me to really draw close to God for the first time in my life. I left training a different person, I learned how to lean on God for strength. By merely having an intimate relationship with Jesus I found hope and happiness I didn’t have before.
                    
                    Depression is a buzzword I don’t like to use, but my former life was not what God had intended for me.
                    
                    Last year, my sophomore year, was my first year back after my hiatus. I still didn’t know what God wanted for me to do as a career and I stubbornly insisted on doing something where I could make a lot of money (pre-med, engineering). But fall semester last year God got a hold of my life and I fully surrendered everything to Him. It was then that I began feeling the call towards vocational ministry! Although it’s too early to say where God wants me, I am seriously considering becoming a Chaplain for the Army! (as I said, I don’t think it’s an accident I ended up in the Army!)
                    
                    Throughout my life, I have seen God take a broken boy living in the world without hope and transform him into someone who is not perfect but is continually seeking him. Now I have hope and Joy in Him and for Him.
