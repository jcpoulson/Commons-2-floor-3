                <h3>Zoe's testimony</h3>
                <p>I grew up in a Christian family, and I’ve gone to church for as long as I can remember. I got baptized at 8-years-old, but I was so young I can barely remember it. I always loved Jesus and church when I was younger, but when I got into high school, I started making some bad decisions and surrounded myself with people who weren’t Christians, even though I went to a Christian high school. This led me to walk away from the Lord for a few years. However, I went to Passion in 2019, and my entire life changed! I rededicated my life to the Lord, and I started making myself more like Jesus. In July 2019 while at a summer camp, I got baptized again to symbolize my rededication to Jesus. Ever since I’ve been at Liberty, my faith has grown so much, and I feel like I started to claim my faith as my own. I’m so excited to see what the Lord has for me this year!</p>
