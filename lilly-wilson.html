                <h3>About Lilly Wilson</h3>
                <p>Hi! My name is Lilly Wilson and I’m from New Bern, NC. I’m a sophomore and I am pursuing a degree in exercise science.</p>

                <h3>Lilly's testimony</h3>
                <p>My testimony has been quite the ride and God still isn’t done changing my life! I was raised in a Christian home so God’s word has been poured into my life from an early age. I was baptized when I was 6 but I really just wanted experience the baptism itself and I didn’t give my life to God. When I was 11 I realized that I wasn’t truly saved so I gave my life to God for real this time. God was doing beautiful things in my life. Fast forward to high school where I was heavily involved with sports and I unfortunately got caught with the wrong crowd. My junior year I tore my ACL and broke my leg and had to have surgery with a year-long recovery process. Just like that, everything I was living for at the moment (sports) was taken away from me. I sank into depression. God never lost sight of me and pulled me back to His side. My renewed walk with Christ grows continually and in ways I could’ve never imagined.
