                <h3>Josie's testimony</h3>
                <p>I grew up in a Christian household, going to a private school up until high school. I had always believed in God, but I never understood the importance of a true relationship with Jesus. Right before I moved to a new high school and new house, my family switched to a new church where I became apart of a life changing youth group. My youth pastor mentored me and showed me how to walk in a relationship with the Lord. From that point I finally started to dive deep into the word and grow in my faith. I have made countless mistakes, but the Lord has taught me so many valuable lessons these past few years. Even just being at liberty for a year, I have grown in so many ways and I cannot wait to see what this upcoming year has in store for me.
