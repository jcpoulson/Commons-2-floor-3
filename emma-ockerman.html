                <h3>About Emma Ockerman</h3>
                <p>Hey guys!! My name is Emma Ockerman and I just graduated from Liberty with my undergrad in psychology. This will be my first year in my masters program here at LU and I am studying clinical and mental health counseling. I was an RS on Commons 2 Floor 5 last year and it was seriously one of the best experiences. I am so so excited to get to do it again on floor 3!! I was a figure skater for ten years and I competed with Liberty’s synchronized skating team for my first two years at school. I absolutely love music and being outside and I can’t wait to have tons of fun hall events and get to know everyone on our floor!!</p>

                <h3>Emma's testimony</h3>
                <p>I was raised in a Christian home so my parents have always talked to me and my five younger siblings about how important it is to love and serve the Lord. I was baptized when I was ten years old but my relationship with Christ really became my own when I got to Liberty. It has been incredible to see the way the Lord has shaped me and how He continues to grow me everyday. I am passionate about ministry and I am so grateful to get to serve in the role of RS. </p>
