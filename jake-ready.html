                <h3>About Jake Ready</h3>
                <p>Hey guys my name is Jake! I’m a Sophomore and grew up in Connecticut. I started college a little late, as I spent the past few years in the military with more than 2 of those years deployed overseas in 7 different countries. This constant change of scenery and my inability to sit still for very long attracted me to wide variety of different hobbies and jobs. I am an Emergency Medical Technician, helicopter fast rope rappelling instructor, carpenter, and certified firearms range safety officer just to name a few of the hats I wear. I spend my free time snorkeling, caving, hiking, rock climbing, shooting, biking, and just doing about anything outdoors. I love meeting new people and I’m extremely extroverted!

                <h3>Jake's testimony</h3>
                <p>I was very fortunate to grow up in a Christian household, but I wasn’t really interested in that kind of (what I saw as) “lifestyle” growing up. I saw Christians as weird and let the culture around me in school and friends define who I was, spending a lot of my time in and out of detention and suspension. That soon changed when my parents left on a Billy Graham special on TV. I saw a man give his testimony on how Jesus changed his rebellious lifestyle as he was “born again” on a new conquest to follow Jesus Christ. As confusing as all that was to me, I was definitely intrigued, as I felt I could somehow relate to that initial opposition to Christians that he had. Slowly after a few months I started reading my Bible, listening to sermons at church, and at 18 I surrendered my life to Christ with a true passion to take up my cross and follow Him daily. I wish I could say that was it; but it wasn’t. I faced many obstacles and challenges that took form in a variety of manifestations the past few years. I became so used to moving around every few months that I didn’t really ever think the high tempo lifestyle I had would end, or that I would at least find myself going back to school. God guided my decisions and placed me here at Liberty, and I couldn’t be more grateful for where I am! I can’t wait to meet everyone, share our experiences, and cultivate relationships on the hall that serve Christ first!
