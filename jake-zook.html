                <h3>About Jacob Zook</h3>
                <p>Hey my name is Jake and I’ll be in my senior year at liberty studying finance! A little bit about me, I’ve grown up in Lancaster county PA (Home of the Amish) for a majority of my life. I enjoy hunting, fishing, hiking, sports and pretty much anything outside but am always up for a good movie night with pizza and breadsticks (necessity of any good movie night). My favorite thing about college so far has been many of the late night, both crazy and deep conversations I’ve been able to have both on and off the hall! My biggest ministry has been dedicated to striving after and creating a strong brotherhood among the guys on our hall as a support system no matter where we are in life.  If you have any questions or want to connect more id love to talk with you and cannot wait to meet up with you in person next year!</p>

                <h3>Jacob's testimony</h3>
                <p>Ive been blessed to grow up in a christian family and have attended church regularly my whole life. I dedicated my life to Christ when I was 5 after hearing a sermon on what christ did and had to sacrifice to save me from my sins. Yet till college I lived a fairly legalistic life on the coattails of my parents faith but quite literally missed out on what It truly meant to be an adopted son of God. After my first year at liberty I really started to go astray in many different areas of my life without my parents faith to hang onto. In my second year though I really began to fully understand what a relationship with Christ truly means and was able to begin surrounding myself with christians who began to fire up my faith. The best way to describe my testimony was a quote i recently heard from a mentor of mine at Liberty. When I first committed my life to Christ I somewhat consider it to be like having fire insurance. But in my second year at Liberty it may sound cheesy but I’ve become more of a firefighter in my faith passionately pursuing a relationship with christ rather than sitting by contently doing nothing to pursue the lord. I cannot wait to see what will happen on our hall next year!</p>
