                <h3>Harrison's testimony</h3>
                <p>I grew up in a very loving family living in a few places, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Virginia Beach, and now Washington DC. Through the years we did go to church for a bit but I never took my faith seriously and while I was quite happy it always feel like something was missing. When I came to liberty I felt immediately welcomed by my hall and wondered what made them different than other people I had been around my whole life. I wanted to know what gave them their purpose, through that whole experience I came to know Christ at 3:00 a.m. on a Thursday morning after groups. It was the best decision I ever made in my life and still am growing in my faith daily. I am always willing to share more about how God is still growing and molding me to be more like Jesus. feel free to contact me at any time!</p>
