                <h3>Taylor's testimony</h3>
                <p>When I was 8 years old, I accepted Jesus into my heart in a Sunday school classroom. My teacher had read the details of the crucifixion of and life lived then followed this up with a gospel presentation. I had a defining moment of how astounding the Lord's love and forgiveness for us really is after this. As a child it is hard to comprehend the idea of omnipotent and abounding love yet also the idea of suffering. When you are conditioned to and assimilated to so few experiences and interactions that would visualize something even close to the death and resurrection of Christ. It really is a testament to our Lord’s intimacy when we are allowed to understand just how much it cost to be redeemed. I had known the basic ideas of Christianity but had not grasped the full picture until that day through the Holy Spirit really enlightening me in ways I earlier could not comprehend. I followed the prayer that my teacher said aloud. I would say this is when I committed my life to Christ but the growth from then to now is really what defines my faith and relationship as I knew Jesus was Lord, died for me, and forgave me of my sins but what I didn't have at 8 years old but now have is a personal relationship with Christ. As I have experienced people in my life hurt me and seen myself fall short time and time again I have come to know the full peace that surpasses understanding in pursuing Jesus recklessly and wholely. Although we are only converted and born again once, that choice to follow Jesus and continue to live out that commitment is something I am convinced I must do everyday.</p>
