                <h3>Grace's testimony</h3>
                <p>When I was seven years old my mom told me a story in the Bible about when a sinful lady threw herself at Jesus’ feet in a Pharisee’s house and cried in repentance of her sins. Jesus saw her heart and her faith and forgave her and told her to go and sin no more. The Holy Spirit convicted me in that moment and I went into another room and asked Jesus to forgive me and make me new. Since that day, I have known the love of Jesus personally and can testify to His faithfulness! I am not perfect and my life has not been the easiest, but I am here to serve each of you this year and am so so excited to form new relationships and see how God molds us to look more like him together! Feel free to reach out to me at anytime for anything! I know me and the rest of our hall’s leadership are so excited to meet each of you and help y’all with anything you may need!</p>
